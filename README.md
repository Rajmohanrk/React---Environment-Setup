"# React---Environment-Setup" 

Environment setup for React JS project using Gulp and Browerify .

Steps to run the setup : 

           * clone / download the setup and run npm install 
           * run Gulp 

We installed and configured :
           * Node 
           * Browserify
           * Bootstrap
           * ESLint
           * Gulp with tasks for builds, file watches and automatic reloads
           
Well now we have the luxurious process for building React components. If you ever want to update the dependencies to the latest version , its as simple as typing npm updatde. If you want to add any other libraries in the future , we simply type npm install and add a require statement to the top of the file where we want to put the new library to work. Its really low friction .
